# BigData-Projet

In this project, the work is based on a dataset commonly used for network intrusion detection.
The dataset contains network traffic data, including both normal and attack behaviors. The
objective is to build and evaluate a machine learning model that can classify different types
of network activities as several types (multi-class classification). This project is to test
the ability to choose appropriate algorithms, preprocess data, and evaluate model
performance.
